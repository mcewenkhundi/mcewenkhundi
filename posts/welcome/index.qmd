Hi there! Welcome!

I have created this Blog so that I can have a space to share my professional journey as a data scientist as well as various data tricks that I have learnt along the way. I intend to share my work and thoughts on different data topics that I am interested in and that others have asked me to do. The site will also double as my on-line Curriculum Vitae to enable future collaborators to have a quick overview of my work.
