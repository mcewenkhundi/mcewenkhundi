    "text": "I am currently pursuing a PhD in medical statistics at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). I am on track to submit my thesis by 30 May 2022.\nMy research goal is to use statistics and mathematical modelling to understand the local spatial variation of infectious diseases to enable better targeted interventions. I also aim to develop tools and methods that assist disease program officers and other researchers to investigate and respond to disease outbreaks. I am also enthusiastic about the use of free open tools in research as well as reproducible workflows of data analysis.\nAfter my PhD I would want to progress towards work experience that offers me opportunities to improve people’s lives in Africa and help to mentor the next generation of researchers."
